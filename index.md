Hi! I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/">Facebook AI Research (FAIR)</a> in New York, broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning. 

I recently graduated with my PhD in Computer Science from the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.
My PhD advisor was <a href='https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/'>Devi Parikh</a>.
My thesis was on "Interpretation, Grounding and Imagination for Machine Intelligence".

For more details on my research see my <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v1CRzeAAAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar</a> page or checkout my <a href="http://vrama91.github.io/publications/">publications</a>. During my PhD, my research was supported by a Google PhD fellowship in Machine Perception, Speech Technology and Computer Vision.

[//]: # "On the vision side, I am interested in problems in vision and language, learning common sense and visual reasoning. On the machine learning side, I am interested in developing tools for effective low-shot learning, generative models, bayesian deep learning and variational inference."

[//]: # "I also care about issues of how we evaluate our models, as we edge towards higher-level AI-complete tasks. In my first project in grad school, I worked on a (now popularly used) evaluation metric for image captioning called CIDEr."

I have been fortunate to work with some great mentors and collaborators during grad school, including <a href="http://larryzitnick.org/">Larry Zitnick</a>,
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/index.html">Dhruv Batra</a>,
<a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/">Kevin Murphy</a>,
<a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~gal/">Gal Chechik</a>, and <a href="http://bengio.abracadoudou.com/">Samy Bengio</a>.

In a previous life, I was an undergrad in ECE at IIIT-Hyderabad where I worked with <a href='http://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna'>K. Madhava Krishna</a> in Robotics. <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/ramakrishnavedantam928/'>Here</a> is a link to my old website.
